Extracting Column from Table

In Ayehu NG, There exists a powerful and convenient activity for getting Row from the table(GetRows).
This activity fetches a particular row from the table. But we don't have the same activity for Column
many times we need to fetch the only column which can be achieved by using two activity RotateTable and GetRows.
I have creaated workflow with proper usage of this activity for getting the column.
