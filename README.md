# Custom Workflows Repository
This is a public workflows repository for Ayehu users to share their content.

We invite you to use the custom workflows, modify them to suit your needs, get involved in the community, and then contribute back whatever new workflows you develop so that others can enjoy and learn from your hard work and build upon it to enhance it even further.

## What are Workflows?
The Ayehu NG platform includes a Workflow Designer - you can design and execute a variety of IT and business processes, and the processes created can be set to run automatically either in response to a specific event, alert or incident, or as part of regularly scheduled tasks. You can also export your work to a file in the XML format, and import workflows shared by your peers who have done the same.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! For instructions about adding/modifying workflows please see our [Custom Workflows Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
